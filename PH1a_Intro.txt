Pure physics

There exist units.
There exist the ability to convert units.
There in lies the ability to multiply by one.

fundamental SI units and Derived SI units

Fundamental
	lenght
	time
	mass

Derived
	velocity
	accel
	area

Special Names For Units
	force
	energy

Units can be used to find out if your answer is correct or not.
Units are needed for everything.

Usage of SI units.


TIME

What is time?

Earth around the sun is 1 year
Moon around earth is aobut 1 month
Earth spins once is 1 day

Use of pendulum or digital clocks.

60 Hz. digital clocks utilize AC to calculate time.
Need a global standard.
Divide a day perhaps?
Howeve,r th Earth day changes in lenght because of mass distrubution and natural disasters(Earthquakes)

Currently a second is something that is very stalbe and reproducible

General relativity depends on gravity.
A clock at a higher hiehgt will run faster due to general relativity.

Python: is a computer language, (NO SHIT)

Monty Python's Flying Circus Named after.
1991 invented
Most recent version is Pyton 3.2.

Will be using 2.7 <- Most used 

Writing Programs:

Wirte a porgram in a text editor
Save the source code with the exteniso of .py
Interpret the file

Write the code in a seperate file or use a 

WingIDE ... FUUUU

Python shell isan interactive interpreter of Python code. Not usaul. This is a stupid thing for poeple that need this type of stuff for you to help them with.  Good for experimenting with code.

Arithmetic expressions with the mathimatical operators.
Floating points are approximation to real numbers.

** is exponent operator
Parenthese force a different order of evaluation

Variables give names to quantities.
Variables must not hold operators that python uses.
Variables cannot have spaces in their name.

Names of varibales are identifiers, infinite length
Identifiers cannot start with a digit and is case sensitive.
Can use results of previous assignments in other ones

Evaluation rule for assignments statements
	   Evaluate the right hand side
	   Assign the resulting value to the variable on the left hand side

Booleans are True and False

Types division
      integers
      floating
      boolean
      strings
      others

Functions take input and output data
Functions must be defined. Some are built-in.
Can have expressions as arguments
Evaluation rule for functions
	   Evaluate the arguemnts
	   Call the function with the results of the first step

Fuctions can have functions calls are arguments. Infinite complexity of function calls.  

Syntax
	def double(x):
	    return x * 2

def is a reserved word that you can't call anything.  Body of the function follows the functions definition name.
return is another reserved word

Functions can have local variables. That disappear after the function exits.
